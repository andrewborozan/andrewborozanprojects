# Welcome!

I am delighted to share with you my learning journey. I am making a transition from the realm of education as a high school history and philosophy teacher to the world of data analytics. In a short time, I have gone from reading and talking about authoritarianism in the 20th century and the structure of ideologies, to learning R, talking Tableau, and studying statistical analysis. It is as if I have entered a portal and started setting up shop in a different universe.

The purpose of this site is to document my process from the land of the qualitative, the home of humanities, into the world of the quantitative, the domain of data.

On this site you will find the following:

-   Completed Projects

-   Tutorials

-   Blog Entries

This is an ongoing process, a meandering adventure full of sometimes fast, sometimes slow growth, steps forward, and sometimes steps backward. I taught students the best way to learn for themselves, and now I must utilize those same strategies to learn new content myself. A primary tactic I will employ to further my own development is one I am familiar with: teaching. Learn by teaching, teach while learning. I always told my students you don't know something very well until you can explain it to a 5th grader. In that vain, I hope to make the content on this site accessible, engaging, fun, conversational, and above all, accurate!

Explore the site, enjoy the material, and watch the video below in which I detail a little more about my unfolding adventure.
