<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Web Scraping Tutorial Part 1</h1>
<h4 class="author">Andrew Borozan</h4>
<h4 class="date">2/15/2022</h4>

</div>


<div id="web-scraping-a-modern-day-superpower" class="section level1">
<h1>WEB SCRAPING: A MODERN DAY SUPERPOWER</h1>
<p>I didn’t hear about web scraping until I entered the data analytics
world. I thought gathering information consisted of clicking from page
to page and reading every jot and tittle. I obviously had no idea how
Google worked (and still don’t to a very large extent). When I learned
of web scraping, I considered it a modern day super power. “You mean I
can take all the information on a website - or even multiple websites -
and put it in a table for analysis? Impossible.” It became one of the
first things I wanted to learn how to do.</p>
<p>After watching a few tutorials, and scouring the internet to fix a
few problems along the way, here is what I learned…</p>
</div>
<div id="tools-you-will-need" class="section level1">
<h1>TOOLS YOU WILL NEED</h1>
<p>Whether this is best practice in the field or not, it is a quirk that
I have: I like loading all the packages I even remotely might use, or
sometimes packages I simply have heard of (“What does”modelr” do? I have
no idea, but some guy mentioned it in a blog I was reading.”). The
pacman package is the best way to load multiple packages at once. I
simply copy and paste this code at the start of most of my projects:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">library</span>(pacman)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">p_load</span>(tidyverse, skimr, scales, rmarkdown, magrittr, lubridate, janitor, htmltab, ggrepel, </span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>       ggthemes, showtext, knitr, rvest, reactable)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The two heavy hitters among this UPS truck of packages is tidyverse
(if you are new to R you will live in the tidyverse multiverse (it is
actually a network of packages) much of your R life) and the rvest
package, which has a whole host of functions that let us steal stuff off
the internet (mostly in the form of data. Admittedly not as good as
money, or diamonds, or rare baseball cards, but some people have the
additional super power of turning scraped data into that stuff. I am not
there - yet - so, the “how to” for taking a data lump of coal and
turning it into a diamond isn’t part of this tutorial.).</p>
<p>#IMDB: I am dat basic</p>
<p>I watched a great tutorial (thank you <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/c/dataslice/videos">DataSlice</a>), and
saw a couple of articles (for example this one from <a
href="https://zenscrape.com/web-scraping-r/">Zenscrape</a>: this article
is almost verbatim the DataSlice tutorial, leading to multiple theories:
1) Zenscrape is Dataslice, 2) Zenscrape watched Dataslice and said “Hey
I can make a blog post version of this YouTube video”, 3) This truly is
the best method to do this stuff, and IMDB is the best website on which
to demonstrate in a tutorial, and these two individuals arrived at these
conclusions independently, 4) There is a rip in the fabric of space time
and Dr. Strange is somehow involved and these are actually two tutorials
from parallel universes that were never supposed to intersect, or
something along those lines.) and it seems like industry standard for
web scraping tutorials is using IMDB as an example. I want to be in the
cool kid club, so that is where we will start in this tutorial as well.
But for those looking for a little more excitement, something a little
more risque than IMDB, we are going to get a little frisky and head over
to Wikipedia for a second example. Because nothing says provocative more
than Hari Seldon’s dream come true (don’t tell me you haven’t read
Foundation…like at least 5 times).</p>
<p>The first step is heading over to imdb.com and finding a “Top”
something list that we can work with. I am going to head over to the
“Most Popular Movies” tab and work from there:</p>
<p>(Screenshot)</p>
<p>Ideally, what I would like to from this website is the title of the
movie, release year, rating, and blurb about the movie. I want all of
this in a table that I can do some analysis on.</p>
<p>Enter web scraping.</p>
<p>In R, put the link</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>link <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">&quot;https://www.imdb.com/chart/top?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&amp;pf_rd_p=470df400-70d9-4f35-bb05-8646a1195842&amp;pf_rd_r=0GMNJA9F5185SGTK1E0Y&amp;pf_rd_s=right-4&amp;pf_rd_t=15506&amp;pf_rd_i=moviemeter&amp;ref_=chtmvm_ql_3&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>page <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_html</span>(link)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Use selector extension tool to get html node that you want.</p>
