<p>Minerva Project Data Exploration</p>
<p>In this project we will be examining survey data from students along
with assessment data on students. We will develop insights and offer
exploration for further study.</p>
<p>First, we load in packages that may help us in our exploration of the
data. Then, we will read in the data provided by Minerva.</p>

<p>Student Course Survey</p>
<p>Let’s look at the survey data first.</p>
<p>{r Cleaning and Skimming, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} #First, let’s
clean the variable names.<br />
survey &lt;- survey %&gt;% clean_names()</p>
<p>#Let’s remove the first row, which contains each question. We will
add the questions in manually in tables and charts below. survey_clean
&lt;- survey %&gt;% slice(-1)</p>
<p>#Let’s get a look at the overall structure of the data
skim(survey_clean)</p>
<p>The survey data includes a response to questions on a Likert scale
and two free response questions (which typically had lower response
rates - 44% and 55%). The questions are grouped by type:</p>
<p>Time spent per week</p>
<p>Agreeableness towards statements about the course</p>
<p>Effectiveness of different elements of the course</p>
<p>Effectiveness of processes within the course</p>
<p>Free response questions addressed areas of improvement and overall
effectiveness.</p>
<p>The first question addresses the amount of time spent engaged with
course material per week by the student.</p>
<p>{r Time spent per week}</p>
<p>font_add_google(“Exo”, “exo”)</p>
<p>showtext_auto()</p>
<p>#We can take a look in tabular format the time spent preparing each
week survey_clean %&gt;% mutate(q1 = factor(x = q1, levels = c(“30
minutes or less”, “1-2 hours”, “2-3 hours”, “3-4 hours”, “5 hours or
more”))) %&gt;% count(q1) %&gt;% mutate(percent_respondents =
percent(round(n/sum(n), digits = 4))) %&gt;% rename(“How much time per
week have you typically spent throughout the semester preparing for this
class?” = “q1”, “Number of Responses” = n, “Percent of Responses” =
percent_respondents) %&gt;% reactable(theme = fivethirtyeight(), striped
= TRUE)</p>
<p>#And as a histogram survey_clean %&gt;% mutate(q1 = factor(x = q1,
levels = c(“30 minutes or less”, “1-2 hours”, “2-3 hours”, “3-4 hours”,
“5 hours or more”))) %&gt;% count(q1, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(q1,
n, fill = q1)) + geom_histogram(stat = “identity”, show.legend = FALSE)+
scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = “magma”, begin = .95, end =
.5)+ scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, 40))+ labs(x =
“Number of hours per week”, y = “Number of responses”, title = “How much
time per week have you typically spent throughout the semester preparing
for this class?”)+ theme(text = element_text(family = “exo”))</p>
<p>A cursory glance suggests a roughly normal distribution. Many of the
responses gravitated towards the 2-3 hour range. 83% of respondents said
they spend between 1 and 4 hours a week.</p>
<p>Next, to the first grouping of questions. The first set of questions
used a 4 point Likert scale of agreeableness to a statement. We will
look at each question and the number of responses for each point on the
Likert scale.</p>

<p>Students are generally favorable towards the program. For each of the
questions at least 80% of the respondents either agree or strongly
agree. From looking at the histograms one of the takeaways is that
students feel less strongly about the fourth question “The course
stimulated new ways of applying the skills and knowledge I have
learned.” This would be a good issue to explore further. An additional
insight is that the highest percentage of responses for “somewhat agree”
reside in the third question - “Course assignments allowed me to
demonstrate my understanding of what I have learned in the course.” 15%
of respondents stated “Somewhat agree”, a higher clip than for the other
questions in this section. This may also need to be explored
further.</p>
<p>Now moving on to the second set of questions which addresses
effectiveness of different elements of the course. This set of questions
is based on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from Not Effective at all to
Extremely Effective.</p>
<p>As with the last set of questions, let’s take a look at the responses
to each question.</p>
<p>{r Effectiveness of different elements of course, out.width=“100%”} #
Making things a little easier, let’s factor each variable and arrange it
in order of the Likert scale</p>

<p>A look at the charts suggests that students believe verbal
discussions are extremely effective. Verbal discussions have the most
positive response rate. While most elements of the course rated
favorably, the response with the most variability over the Likert scale
was the effectiveness of face to face sessions. One would imagine
face-to-face session would have facilitated discussions, but the two do
not seem to be linked somehow. This is something to explore further.</p>
<p>Before moving to the free response questions we will take a look at
the last set of questions that used the Likert scale. While on the
surface it seems as if the same 5 point scale was used for the last set
of questions, which deal with effectiveness of processes within the
course, after looking at the responses, it is more likely that a 2 point
scale was used: “Slightly Effective” and “Effective”.</p>
<p>Completion rates were lower for this section: only 72% responded to
each of these questions.</p>
<p>The same approach used in the previous sections will be employed here
to get a snapshot of the responses for each question in this section.
However, the results are limited with the smaller response rate and
structure of the questions (the 2 point scale as opposed to the 5 point
scale). Non-responses are removed, however the percentage in the
histograms do reflect the percentage of all students.</p>

and more nuance would be needed.</p>
<p>Finally, there were two free response questions included in the
survey. We will run a quick sentiment analysis on the comments to see if
the comments were more positive or negative in tone.</p>

<p>According to the sentiment analysis the responses to question 4,
which addressed areas of improvement, were generally positive. In
scrolling through the responses, some answers more directly offered
suggestions for improvement and others were just general comments. There
were a few comments noting the effectiveness of the professor. As was
seen in the question about face-to-face sessions, some students
commented on a need for restructuring these.</p>
<p>{r Sentiment analysis for Question 6} comments_q6 &lt;- survey_clean

<p>Question 6, which prompted the students to comment on the
effectiveness of Forum, showed overall positive sentiment. According to
this analysis, the students were favorable towards the Forum.</p>
<p>Course Learning Outcomes</p>

<p>Scores Over Time</p>
<p>The first aspect we will look at is the relationship between scores
over time by learning outcome. We will do this in two different charts:
one chart will overlay all learning outcomes, while the other will facet
them to make them easier to read.</p>

<p>A look at these charts show a peculiar pattern: There seems to be an
upward tick in scores for almost all learning outcomes (logic and
science of learning excluded) in the month of November. This is a
curious finding that would need further exploration to identify the
cause. Many of the scores came down from their peak in November into
December.</p>
<p>We can look at individual students’ scores in the same manner. For
the student with the ID 15375:</p>

filter(target_users_id == 15375) %&gt;% group_by(learning_outcomes_name,

ID that is entered. The example here is for student ID 15743.</p>
<p>(There is a way to make this interactive with Shiny apps, but
unfortunately that is a little beyond my skill set right now. It is one

<p>Next, we will take a look at scores over time by assessment type. It
is similar to the concept above, but this time we will see the
relationship between scores and assessment type. We can put this into
one chart (no need to facet) because there are only five different
assessment types.</p>
<p>{r Scores over time by assessment type}</p>
<p>outcomes %&gt;% group_by(outcome_assessments_type,
outcome_assessments_created_date) %&gt;% summarize(avg_score =
mean(outcome_assessments_score, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%

= c(1, 2, 3, 4), limits = c(0, 4.5))+ theme(text = element_text(family =
“exo”, size = 20), plot.title = element_text(size = 20))</p>
<p>From the plot we can see that if the assessment was of a “general”
type, it tended to score relatively low. However, as seen earlier, there
were far fewer “general” assessment types overall. It would be
interesting to have more information on what consitutes a “general”
assessment. It would also be interesting to see if scores for each type
were due to student’s attitudes and efforts on the assessment type
(e.g. student’s not appreciating or putting as much effort into
pre-class assignments), or if they were due to teacher/assessor
attitudes and/or predilections.</p>
<p>As with the learning outcomes, we can zoom in and look at individual
student scores by assessment type over time. Included in the chunk below
is a function to search individual students. The first plot is for
student ID 15375 and the second is for student ID 15743.</p>

<p>Combining both assessment type and learning outcome, we can take a
look at the range, median, and quartiles of each assessment per learning
outcome. First, we look at these in a traditional box plot. The learning
outcomes have been grouped into eight categories. The top 7 - logic,
bias, heuristics, science of learning, right problem, gap analysis, and
break it down - all had close to at least 400 assessments to draw scores
from (logic led the way with 1561). The rest had less than 300.
Therefore, they were grouped into an “other” category.</p>

<p>A few observations from the plots above. “Ridges” with high peaks
suggest very low variability in score. Pre-class assignments in science
of learning are notable: there is a large peak around 2. With large
peaks, one wonders if students are aware of the expectations, if there
is a default by the one assessing the work to gravitate towards a
certain score, or if some other factor is at play. Other “ridges” are
either bimodal (general assessments in break it down) or multimodal
(much of the data presented here). It is interesting to see which
assessments skew high or low. Videos skew high for each learning
outcome, while pre-class assignments generally skew slightly lower.</p>
<p>The next plot helps us get a look at how all scores are distributed
over time by both assessment type and learning outcome. There is a lot
going on in this plot, and it looks a little wild, but the advantages of
this plot include being able to identify trends (demonstrated by the
regression lines) and being able to see if the learning outcomes are all
being addressed equally. The underlying data and how assessments are
recorded (on the first of each month) make the plots look a little goofy
(in column format as opposed to spread out over time), but the general
idea remains. The plot is displayed both statically and as an
interactive. (Note, there were no assignments given in September.)</p>
<p>{r Scores over time by learning outcomes and assessment type,
out.width=“100%”} #Plotly graphs of each assessment by type and outcome
over time scores_by_assesstype &lt;- outcomes %&gt;%
drop_na(outcome_assessments_score) %&gt;%
ggplot(aes(outcome_assessments_created_date, outcome_assessments_score,
label = target_users_id)) + geom_point() + geom_jitter(aes(color =
learning_outcomes_name))+ geom_smooth(method = “lm”, color = “black”) +
labs(x = ““, y =”Assessment Score”, title = “Scores over time by type

“magma”, discrete = TRUE, begin = .95, end = .2)+ facet_wrap(~
outcome_assessments_type, scales = “free”)+ theme(panel.spacing =
unit(1.5, “lines”), axis.line=element_line(), text = element_text(family

<p>scores_by_assesstype</p>
<p>#For interactive plot ggplotly(scores_by_assesstype,)</p>
<p>From the plot we can see that all assessment types, except for
general, had at least a slight upward trend. It is noticeable that logic
seemed to be the theme during the month of October. More variation
across time for each learning outcome might be a more desirable
route.</p>
<p>Looking at the data in this manner can highlight trends across
assessment type and learning outcomes.</p>
<p>One Final Table</p>
<p>It might be helpful for teachers or administration to have a table
which provides student score information and is easily searchable. Here
is the beginning of such a table.</p>
<p>{r} student_avg_by_month &lt;- outcomes %&gt;%
drop_na(outcome_assessments_score) %&gt;% group_by(target_users_id,
outcome_assessments_created_date) %&gt;% summarize(avg_score =
round(mean(outcome_assessments_score), digits = 2)) %&gt;%
spread(outcome_assessments_created_date, avg_score) %&gt;%
rename(“September 2021” = “2021-09-01”, “October 2021” = “2021-10-01”,
“November 2021” = “2021-11-01”, “December 2021” = “2021-12-01”) %&gt;%
select(-“2022-01-01”)</p>
<p>reactable(student_avg_by_month, wrap = TRUE, theme =
fivethirtyeight(), striped = TRUE, fullWidth = TRUE, searchable = TRUE,
sortable = TRUE, filterable = TRUE, pageSizeOptions = 25, highlight =
TRUE, showSortIcon = TRUE)</p>
<p>The table could be improved by parsing the scores even further by
learning outcomes or types of assessment.</p>
<p>Conclusions and Moving Forward</p>
<p>In reflecting on the analysis throughout, some general trends came to
light:</p>
<p>The survey data suggests favorable attitudes by the students towards
the course.</p>
<p>The course learning outcomes data suggests some learning outcomes are
more of a focus than others (logic being predominant).</p>
<p>The course learning outcomes data suggests a slight upward trend in
scores over time, although statistical tests would have to be performed
to see if these are significant.</p>
<p>Areas of further analysis:</p>
<p>No exploration was done in regards to the Klass ID. Scores can be
examined by the Klass ID to see if there are any trends on that
level.</p>
<p>Clarity and more rigorous collection methods in the area of
assessment weighting might provide clues about patterns of scores for
each assessment type (e.g. why do preclass assignments tend to have
lower scores?).</p>
<p>Statistical tests need to be run to compare the scores across each of
these categories.</p>
<p>Suggestions in light of the findings:</p>
<p>As intimated earlier, some learning outcomes were addressed way more
than others. Assessing each learning outcome an equal amount might be a
better tactic. There were a couple of student comments that also
suggested there could be more clarity about the learning outcomes. The
learning outcomes are by nature abstract concepts/skills, and as such
will invite at least slight variations in definition/understanding
between individuals, but it might be desirable to be more clear in which
tasks and content require which skill. Identifying which learning
outcomes are working in concert on any given task, and being explicitly
clear as to how, might help students start to identify the
interconnectivity of these concepts for themselves.</p>
<p>The survey data suggested that face-to-face procedures may need to be
revisited and revised. Not knowing the current format and practices,
suggestions here are limited. However, from reading the comments it
seems like these sessions could be used to practice the learning
outcomes in more “real-world” situations.</p>
<p>More data regarding student progress is desired, though, the
collection of this data should be as non-intrusive as possible. One does
not want to create a culture of constant assessment. Novel ways to
collect evidence, for instance through text mining/analytics, would
allow the student to “act naturally” while evidence of their learning
and understanding are being collected. In the survey data, verbal
discussions rated very highly, however, these interactions are more
difficult to assess. New technologies can help us gather, analyze, and
evaluate understanding as demonstrated in verbal discussions, adding
more data to provide a more comprehensive picture of student
achievement.</p>
