<h1 class="title toc-ignore">“I am crazy” and other thoughts that
flitter through my head.</h1>

<p><br></p>
<p>Thoughts are funny to think about. We have them all the time, and yet
the anatomy of a thought is rarely the object of our thought…well,
because…it’s tricky…and kind of paradoxical, if that is the right word
for it, kind of like a mirror trying to reflect itself….and because we
usually have better things to think about. I can’t remember where I read
this (the beginning of every good anecdote) but someone was trying to
dissect humor and claimed the very act of analyzing humor was a very
unfunny thing. Trying to analyze thought has a similar dizzying quality
about it: the very act is the object…upon which we act. Really smart
people have picked and prodded this conundrum - Plato, Descartes, Daniel
Dennett, and countless other people who get paid to think for a living
(lucky bastards) - and I don’t know if they “solved” anything in regards
to what is really happening when we think about thoughts. In my own
musings, to help me understand thoughts better, it seems like thoughts
come in two different categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Conscious thoughts</p></li>
<li><p>Fly-at-you-out-of-nowhere thoughts</p></li>
</ol>
<p>First, the anatomy of conscious thought. These are the controlled and
directed thoughts - controlled and directed by the will of the thinker.
These conscious thoughts are the objects that we typically think of when
we think of “thinking.” “I am thinking about something” means that a
person (or animal, I suppose…not quite the time or place to get into the
levels or animal consciousness) is willfully, purposefully directing
their attention to definite (or maybe ill-defined but working towards
definition) objects that inhabit the mind in either a spacial sense (the
classic “don’t think of a pink elephant” leads you to imagining an image
of pink elephant) or a linguistic-audial sense (one can imagine sounds
and words), or both at the same time. That was a turgid way of saying
“When we think, we think about stuff” but the main point to be made here
is that conscious thoughts are had because a person was willfully having
them. Conscious thoughts are what we have when we study something, or,
typically, when we read, or, hopefully, when we are conversing with
someone.</p>
<p>Fly-at-you-out-of-nowhere thoughts, the second colorful category in
this broad brushed painting, are those thoughts that seem to come from
nowhere in particular, at least, not from within. They arrive from the
ether, outside of anything that could be distinguished as our own
“mind.” They just happen to you. It is the song that you have stuck in
your head from the moment you wake up (“Guns and Roses isn’t a terrible
soundtrack for the day, but where did that come from? What was I
dreaming about?”). It is that thought of jumping when looking over the
edge of a high cliff - you didn’t think of that, it just bombarded your
brain (wait…nobody else has this phenomenon happen to them? I guess I
won’t use my “that thought of randomly punching or kissing someone”
example then…). You don’t control them, they just happen.</p>
<p>One easily turns into the other too. Fly-at-you-out-of-nowhere
thoughts frequently become conscious thoughts if followed or entertained
(even if what constitutes “followed” or “entertained” is murky at best.
Is it determined by duration? An intensity? Finishing the song in your
head?). A flitting thought is often a caterpillar that metamorphosizes
into a conscious butterfly.</p>
<p>Let’s stick with these two categories of thought to describe the
thoughts that have been either occupying my attention (conscious
thought) or whizzing through my head (Fly-at-you-out-of-nowhere thought)
during the past few months, as I have made the decision (a conscious
thought of action) to give up the teaching profession and enter the
rabbit hole of data analytics. Many of these thoughts begin as fly-bys,
but are quickly caught and digested by consciousness.</p>
<p>One persistent gnat of a thought is the title’s namesake: “Am I
crazy?” Most of the time this is an external thought milling around my
head that I attempt to swat away. It usually comes on the heels of a
frustrating effort to learn something new (“I can’t figure out how to
make this chart look the way I want in Tableau”). I guess there is
something about fly-at-you-out-of-nowhere thoughts; they aren’t entirely
out of nowhere. They can be precipitated by a condition, for instance a
mood or situation. A fly sees an open window and buzzes on in for a
visit. At my best, I shoo it back out the window or swat it dead. But
sometimes I follow it. Sometimes the “Am I crazy?” becomes a conscious
thought. At the beginning of this journey, the “Am I crazy” became the
conscious thought… \n “I am crazy. I had it made as a teacher, an
international teacher at that. I called being an international
teacher”the cheat code to life”; why on earth would I give that up? I
traveled the world. I mean, look at some of things I saw…</p>

<p class="caption"><em>The famous train from Kandy to Ella in Sri Lanka
(which I also rode)…</em></p>

<p class="caption"><em>…and the Church of St. John at Kaneo in Ohrid,
North Macedonia.</em></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>I made a fine living, the job was stressful and there was a lot of
work, but it wasn’t too bad…at least from a distance. I was well
respected: my kids worshiped me, my colleagues praised me, my admin
seemed to be aware of my ability to get kids excited about just about
anything (I taught epistemology to 16 year olds…and they loved it). In
this realm, I was confident and poised, facing any challenge with the
assurance that I would be successful.</p>
<p>And I am trading in this kingdom for…data analytics? Something I know
literally nothing about other than what I read and saw in Moneyball?
Curse you Michael Lewis and Billy Beane and Brad Pitt. I don’t know
anything about coding, or databases, or visualization platforms. I have
never heard of R, Python, or Tableau. What does SQL stand for? I have no
idea. I barely know how to open Excel.”</p>
<p>The “Am I crazy” rears its head periodically even after I learned
some of that stuff, like how to manipulate data in Excel and what SQL
stands for. I am nagged still by that pesky thought which crosses into
the conscious at times: “I should just go back into teaching - it is so
much easier and I am good at it. I can’t do this stuff. I can’t figure
out _________ (fill in the blank with any number of things: web
scraping, Python, how to make popping visualizations)…and I never will.
I watch these tutorials and see these people who are brilliant at this
stuff and that just isn’t me. I can read SQL and R fine, but if someone
gives me an objective and says”Alright, go write a script to get the
information,” I freeze. I am crazy for trying this…”</p>
<p>“Am I crazy” has a partner in crime: “I am going to fail.” It is easy
to see how one line of thinking leads to the next. “I am crazy for
trying this…because I am going to fail in the attempt.” I don’t think I
have the same crippling fear of failure I once had (still hanging onto
my fear of sharks though), but even if I don’t cower at it as I once
did, I still don’t want to fail. And failure is a very real possibility.
I come from the land of the humanities: history major in college,
masters in history and philosophy, taught both during my teaching
career, the books, the podcasts, the movies I consumed, all of it miles
away from the quantitative quarry of data analytics. I don’t have the
background, I don’t have the props, and so bombing on this stage is a
tangible prospect. And then what? Tell everybody I tried and failed? Had
to go back to teaching because I just couldn’t hack it in data. Too much
math. Too much “computer stuff” that I just didn’t understand. Back to
teaching about Hitler and Stalin and how to write a good essay. There is
a lot of shame in admitting defeat.</p>
<p>The fly-by “failure”, if entertained in consciousness, is a little
dark and dank.</p>
<p>But the “Am I crazy” and “I am going to fail” aren’t the only
fly-at-you-out-of-nowhere thoughts I have had the past few months. There
are the moments when something does click, times when I make a stunning
viz, or write a bit of code that makes me go “I didn’t know a computer
could do that,” and the thought hits me: I can do this. Not only can I
do this, I could be good at this. Those are the fleeting thoughts you
want to hold on to, to walk with, to follow all the way down to the very
bottom. They are the fly-by thoughts that turn into these conscious
gems:</p>
<p>“I have a lot of learning to do, but I also need to appreciate the
distance I have already traveled. I am really comfortable in R and can
do things like scrape data off a website. I didn’t even know what web
scraping was a mere five months ago, and now I can write a program that
can jump page to page and pull data. And I can put that data into a data
frame that I can analyze and put into a visualization. How cool is that?
I can do some rudimentary sentiment analysis. I can make tables and
plots that look like they could have been on fivethirtyeight. I can do
some really cool things in Excel like run Monte Carlo simulations,
problem-solver analysis, and linear regression analysis. I can do all of
that. And if I can do that in a narrow window of time, think of what I
can do with more exposure, more reps, more time. I always told my
students that they can learn anything if they just work hard enough.
Work ethic is the only thing that matters - that is what I constantly
preached. Look at me live it. I am working hard and learning how to live
in an entirely different one that I lived in for the first 36 years of
my life.</p>
<p>Good job.”</p>
<p>Much more pleasant conscious dwellings.</p>
<p>The thing about thoughts is that they kind of dictate one’s
perception of reality - perception being the operative word here. It is
not that thinking certain thoughts changes objective reality, no matter
how many books Eckhart Tolle and other spiritual gurus write suggesting
otherwise. I can’t simply think that I am rich and famous and have 2
billion Twitter followers and it is reality. It is more along these
lines: general dispositions and foundational ethical beliefs guide
behavior. My belief in the benefits of hard work, passed down from me by
my parents, and from their parents, leads to a reality in which I work
hard. The trite saying, “Those who believe they can and those who
believe they can’t are both right,” while eye-rollingly corny on a cat
poster hanging in someone’s cubicle, is kind of profound in a way:
thoughts matter. Thoughts influence perception and perception influences
how we interact with reality. Not all thoughts find their derivation in
the recess of our mind; some are those fly-at-you-out-of-nowhere
thoughts that don’t have much bearing on defining the core of who we
are. But those conscious thoughts, those thoughts that captivate our
attention, those are the thoughts that shape both reality and
identity.</p>
<p>The great thing is that if we notice our thoughts a little more,
identifying the fly-bys and the conscious thoughts, we can be more
intentional in picking and choosing which thoughts we want to influence
us. Being selective in our thoughts changes how we see and live in the
world.</p>
<p>I have had a lot of thoughts over the past few months. Some fly-by,
many conscious. Some dreary, others celebratory. A wide gamut of “I am
making a terrible mistake” to “I am going to be the best analyst in the
world.” In thinking about my thoughts though, I have to keep this one
thought in mind: lead the positive ones into conscious thought. Focus on
the thoughts that reaffirm an uplifting and determined attitude. That is
the only way I am going to have a successful switch.</p>
<p>Am I crazy? Yeah, but I also think I can do this.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>(I really did see some really cool stuff traveling the world. It
helps to have a nice camera to capture some if it. Here are some more
pictures of my travels and a snapshot into the life of an international
school teacher.)</p>
